We'll write the short Python module named [[pyex]], residing in 
[[<<pyex.py>>]].
(The literate source code is in a file [[pyex.nw]] that should reside in the 
[[/src]] directory.)
This module cannot be run, only imported.
It contains only functions and constants.
<<pyex.py>>=
"""
This is an example module that illustrates docstrings in Python.
"""

<<constants>>
<<functions>>
@

We also want to do testing with [[pytest]].
Normally, the tests resides in a directory [[/tests]].
